# Reachability Types

Reachability types are a new take on modeling lifetimes and sharing in high-level functional languages, showing how to integrate Rust-style reasoning capabilities with higher-order functions, polymorphic types, and similar high-level abstractions.

## Mechanization Overview

* [`base`](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/reachability/tree/main/base/) -- Coq mechanization of the $λ^*$-calculus [1] and its variations, gradually increasing in complexity.

* [`effects`](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/reachability/tree/main/effects/) -- Coq mechanization of the $λ_\varepsilon^*$-calculus [1] and its variations, gradually increasing in complexity.

* [`polymorphism`](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/reachability/tree/main/polymorphism/) -- Coq mechanization of the $λ^\diamond$-calculus [2] and its variations, featuring a refined reachability model that scales to parametric type polymorphism.

* [`log-rel-unary`](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/reachability/tree/main/log-rel-unary/) -- Unary logical relations for proving semantic type soundness and termination of $λ^\diamond$, $λ_\varepsilon^\diamond$, and its variants [4,5].

* [`log-rel-binary`](https://github.com/TiarkRompf/reachability/tree/main/log-rel-binary/) -- Binary logical relations for establishing equational reasoning about $λ^\diamond$, $λ_\varepsilon^\diamond$, and its variants [4].


## Prototype Implementations

* Interactive [prototype](http://tiarkrompf.github.io/notes/?/graph-ir/) for [1],
also demonstrating the use of reachability types for graph-based IRs for impure functional languages [3].

* A standalone prototype language [Diamond](https://github.com/Kraks/diamond-lang) implements
polymorphic reachability types [2].
