# Mechanizations of Reachability Types

## Overview

* [`base`](base) -- Coq mechanization of the $λ^*$-calculus [1] and its variations, gradually increasing in complexity.

* [`polymorphism`](polymorphism) -- Coq mechanization of the $λ^\diamond$-calculus [2] and its variations, featuring a refined reachability model that scales to parametric type polymorphism.

## Acknowledgements

The mechanizations based on sets reuse some libraries by the [UPenn PL Club](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/popl08-tutorial/code/index.html) that complement the FSet library shipping with [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/distrib/current/stdlib/Coq.FSets.FSetInterface.html). We further
would like to thank [Boruch-Gruszecki et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11896), whose artifact taught us how to set up the FSet library with extensional equality.
