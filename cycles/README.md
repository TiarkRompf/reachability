# Reachability Types with Cyclic References

## Overview

The $Î»_{<:}^\circ$-calculus, a polymorphic reachability model with cyclic references.

* [`Fsub-Cycles-Nat`](f_sub_cycles_nat) -- Bounded type-and-reachability polymorphism with cyclic references and natural numbers. This is the artifact corresponding to the [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07328).
* [`Fsub-Cycles-Esc`](f_sub_cycles_esc) -- Reachability Types with cyclic references, natural numbers, and escaping. This is the official artifiact for OOPSLA25 submission on title "Complete the Cycle: Reachability Types with Expressive Cyclic References."
