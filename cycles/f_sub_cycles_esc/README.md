## Getting Started Guide

### Requirements

- **Coq version**: 8.17.1  
- **OCaml version**: 4.13.1

Depending on the hardware used, compilation can take from **35-65 minutes**. If time-constrained, you may inspect `.vo` files and example scripts directly.

### Hardware Used

Compilation was tested on a machine with the following specifications:

- Architecture: x86\_64
- CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8168 @ 2.70GHz, 96 physical cores (192 threads)
- RAM: 768 GB
- OS: Linux, 64-bit

### Installation Guide

If you do not have OPAM installed, follow the instructions at
https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html. Then continue below with steps 1–3.

#### 1. Create a fresh switch with the required OCaml version
```
opam switch create reachability-coq 4.13.1
eval $(opam env)
```

#### 2. Install Coq and dependencies
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq.8.17.1
```

Check that the installation succeeded:

```
coqc -v
# Should output: The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.17.1
```

#### 3. Build the Proof

To compile the development, run the following commands in the root directory:

```
coq_makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
make
```

## Paper-to-Artifact Correspondence

This artifact accompanies the paper and corresponds to the system described in
**Section 4**, which is an extension based on the system presented in **Section
3**. It includes metatheory presented in **Section 3.5** and case studies
presented in **Section 5**.

The following tables list correspondence between definitions/lemmas in the
mechanization and that in the paper. All mechanized lemmas are located in
`f_sub_cycles_esc.v`, and all examples are located in `examples.v`

#### Notes on Examples 

The examples in the artifact are identical in behavior to those in the paper,
but are presented using our Coq term syntax with a **standard locally nameless
representation**. In particular, we use **de Bruijn indices** for variables
instead of named `let`-bindings. De Bruijn indices `#k` refer to the *k*-th
binder outward: `#0` is the nearest binder, `#1` is the next nearest binder,
etc. Since in every function there is a self reference, `#0` refers to the
function self reference, and `#1` refers to the argument applied to the
function. 

For example, Landin's knot in Figure 1b  

```
val c = ref (λy. y)  
def f(x: Unit) = { (!c)(x) }  
c := f
```

is mechanized as

```
tlet (tsref (tabs tunit))                  (* c = ref (λy. y) *)  
     (#1 ::= (tabs (tapp (! #3) #1)))      (* c := λz. (!c)(z) *)
```

Here, `tlet` encodes `val … in …`, `tsref` is the reference constructor, `tabs`
is λ-abstraction, `(::=)` is assignment, and `!` is dereference. With De
bruijin indices, `#1` is the nearest binder, and `#3` refers to the next
nearest binder. The reason we skip `#0` and `#2` is because they are function
self references and are not used in the abstraction body. 

The left-hand-side of the assignment statement `#1` refers to the nearest
binder, which is `c` in its local context. For `tapp (! #3) #1`, `#1` refers to
the nearest binder `x` of function `f`, `#3` refers to the second nearest
binder, which is `c`. Thus, `tapp (! #3) #1` is exactly `(!c)(z)` in the
paper's syntax. We will update the artifact documentation to make this
correspondence explicit for each paper example.

Similarly, the escaping reference example in Figure 3b

```
def mkRef() =  
  val x = ... // T^c  
  val c = new Ref(x) // μx. Ref[T^x]^c  
  c  
```

is mechanized as:  

```
Definition escaping_example' : tm :=  
  λ (tlet #1 (tlet (tsref #1) #1)).
```

Here, `λ` is λ-abstraction, `tlet` encodes `val … in …`, `tsref` is the
reference constructor, and `#k` is a de Bruijn index referring to the *k*-th
binder outward. In this term:  

- The outer `λ` introduces the function parameter, which is `#1` inside its body.  
- The first `tlet` binds `x = #1` (the parameter).  
- The inner `tlet` binds `c = tsref #1`, where this `#1` now refers to the let-bound `x`.  
- The final `#1` in the body of the inner `tlet` refers to `c` and is the return value.  

This matches the paper's example exactly: create a value `x`, store it in a new
reference `c`, and return `c`.

Figure 2b is substantially similar to `typing_parallel_update`, in the
sense that the two blocks reference two distinct references, although there is
a transitively reachable path between the references via the store.  Besides,
Section 5.2 is also substantially similar to `typing_parallel_update`, except
that the mechanized example only has two distinct references, rather than four,
but it demonstrates the same safety property of performing parallel updates on
references with transitive reachability via the store.

## Explicit Axioms and Assumptions

No lemmas are admitted in the main proof. The system is proven end-to-end. 

In the examples, `typing_par` is an axiom that assumes a function
taking two closures capturing disjoint/separate resources, which is not an
essential contribution of this work, and thus is left unproven. It is used to
demonstrate safe parallel update, that two transitively reachable references
via the store are nevertheless considered disjoint/separate.

To audit axioms and admits, run the following commands below. You should
expect to see outputs similar to:

```
# To check for trusted axioms in compiled modules:
coqchk -R . Top *.vo
# To manually check for admitted proofs or axioms:
grep -rn 'Axiom\|Admitted' .
```

Upon running the second command, you should expect to see output similar to the
following:

```
./examples.v:476:Axiom typing_par : forall (Γ : tenv) (φ : qual) (Σ : senv),
```

### Deviations from the Paper

The type system formalization uses Locally Nameless Representation, where terms
are represented using named free variables and de Bruijn indices for bound
variables (cf. Aydemir et al., 2008).

Some typing rules have been split into multiple separate ones in mechanization
to aid analysis. Notable differences include: 

- `T-APP` in the paper is implemented by `t_app_var`, `t_app_empty`, and
  `t_app` in the mechanization, where the former two correspond to special
  cases of the rule where the premise of the highlighted condition in `T-APP`
  does not hold.

## Reusability Guide

The following components are reusable and extensible for future research:

- `lang.v`: This file contains core language definitions, suitable for
  extending with new constructs.
- `qualifiers_base.v`, `qualifiers_slow.v`, `qualifiers.v`: Modular and general
  qualifier reasoning. `qualifiers_slow.v` contains computationally expensive
  lemmas about the qualifiers that do not need to be recompiled when other
  components are modified.
- `f_sub_cycles_esc.v`: This file contains the type system framework and main
  lemmas leading to the soundness theorems.
- `examples.v`, `examples_infra.v`: These are mechanized case studies, and can
  be used as templates for developing new examples.

To create a new example, follow the structure of `fixpoint_typable` or
`escaping_example_typable`. 

To add a new typing rule, extend the inductive `has_type` in
`f_sub_cycles_esc.v` and adapt supporting lemmas accordingly.

### Limitations

- `f_sub_cycles_esc.v` has a large file size. The artifact can be made more
  reusable by breaking this file into logically separate components.
- Case studies in `examples.v` generally require long proofs. Implementing
  automation and tactics for common proof patterns can reduce the effort for
  proving examples.
- Compilation time is nontrivial. Improving the compilation time can involve
  serious investments in redesigning the underlying qualifier structure and
  efficient automation tactics.

We thank the reviewers for their time and care in evaluating this artifact. We
hope this formalization proves useful for understanding, validating, and
extending the system described in our paper.
