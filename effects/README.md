# Reachability Types and Effects

## Overview

The $λ^*_\varepsilon$-calculus [1] and variants, combining reachability with flow-(in)sensitive effects. More versions are forthcoming.

* [`Base`](./lambda_star_effect_base) -- The base version of $\lambda^*$ with a simple flow-insensitive effect system.
* [`Kill`](./lambda_star_kill) -- The version of $\lambda^*$ with use and kill effect.
